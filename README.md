Note: 
1. We can implement pagination for large set of books. 
2. CSS can be improved with bootstrap/material.
3. I reused my code from [react-message-preview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-message-preview) module which was developed by in React V15 earlier.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
